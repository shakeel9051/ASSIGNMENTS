In this program, we have two separate try-except blocks. The first block attempts to print an undefined variable undefined_variable, which raises a NameError. The exception is caught, and a custom message is printed indicating that the variable is not defined.

The second block attempts to add a string and an integer (x + y), which would result in a TypeError. The exception is caught, and a custom message is printed indicating that the operation between different data types is unsupported.

When you run the program, it will output:
NameError: The variable is not defined.
TypeError: Unsupported operation between different data types.
